## My process
- I created a copy of the image in Figma for practice and to get the correct sizing / spacing. 
- Wrote the HTML using scemantic HTML as much as possible 
- Applied CSS trying to use custom properties where applicable

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Structuring the HTML with the correct tags and appropriate classes is necessary to make writing the CSS as simple as possible.

### Continued development

I want  to focus on making my CSS as readable as possible and to understand margins and padding and where each one is appropriate to create the necessary spacing.
